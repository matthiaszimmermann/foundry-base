# Foundry Base Repository

This repository provides a complete development environment for building and testing Solidity smart contracts using Foundry within a VSCode DevContainer setup.

## Purpose 

The setup includes OpenZeppelin V5 contracts and upgradeable contracts, allowing developers to easily create, deploy, and test upgradeable smart contracts. 

The repository features a pre-configured dev container setup to ensuring consistency across environments. 
A sample upgradeable ERC20 contract and corresponding test cases are included to serve as a blueprint on how to use the setup.

## Sample Contracts 

The repository provides two sample Solidity smart contracts in subfolder `src`.

- **Counter**: A very simple smart contract
- **Token**: An upgradeable token contract using OpenZeppelin V5

Corresponding tests are located in subfolder `test`.

## Preparation

To use this repository the following software is required:

- Git
- Docker
- VSCode

## Initial Setup

1. Clone repository into directory of your choice
1. Open VSCode in this directory
1. Run Devcontainer setup


### Git Submodules Checkout

The project makes use of Git submodules for dependencies.
After cloning the repository also checkout the submodules using the command shown below. 

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

To update the submodules, use the following command.

```shell
git submodule update --recursive
```

## Using Foundry

### Forge Format

Formats Solidity files to common standard.
The command `forge fmt --check` should not show any errors before pushing to Github.

```shell
$ forge fmt
$ forge fmt --check
```

### Forge Build

```shell
$ forge build
$ forge build --sizes
```

### Forge Test

Runs tests. 
The command `forge test` should not show any errors before pushing to Github.

```shell
$ forge test
$ forge test --mt test_Token
$ forge test --gas-report
$ forge coverage
```

## Run Bot

### Start a Local Anvil Chain

1. Open a new terminal
1. Reset the `.env` file with a newly created account
1. Unset old env variables
1. Set new mnemonic variable
1. Start `anvil` with it

```shell
uv run python3 bot/init.py > .env
unset ETH_ADDRESS ETH_PRIVATE_KEY ETH_MNEMONIC
export ETH_MNEMONIC=$(grep ETH_MNEMONIC .env | cut -d\" -f2)
anvil --mnemonic $ETH_MNEMONIC
```

### Deploy Counter Contract to Local Anvil

1. Open a new shell
1. Run deploy script with `forge script` using the new private key in the `.env` file
1. Record the address of the newly deployed contract (used as `<contract-address>` below)

```shell
forge script script/Counter.s.sol --fork-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --broadcast --private-key $(grep ETH_PRIVATE_KEY .env | cut -d= -f2)
```

### Interact with the Counter Contract

1. set the `ETH_MNEMONIC` variable using the `.env` file
1. Start a python shell

```shell
eval $(echo export $(grep MNEMONIC .env))
uv run python3
```

Follow the steps in the python shell below.

```python
import os

from web3 import Web3
from bot.web3.contract import Contract
from bot.web3.wallet import Wallet

# create account using the env variable mnemonic
w = Wallet.from_mnemonic(os.getenv('ETH_MNEMONIC'))

# verify that w3_uri matches with your anvil chain
w3_uri = "http://127.0.0.1:8545"
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(w3_uri))
c_address = "<contract-address>"
c = Contract(w3, "Counter", c_address)

# contract call example
c.number()

#Â contract tx examples
tx1 = c.increment({'from': w})
tx2 = c.setNumber(42, {'from': w})

# extract logs example
# for filter parameter see https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getlogs 
logs = c.get_logs({'fromBlock':'latest'})
c.contract.events.NumberUpdated.process_log(logs[0])
```
